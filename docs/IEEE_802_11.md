# IEEE 802.11

- IEEE 802.11 is part of the IEEE 802 set of local area network (LAN) and specifies the set of Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) protocols for implement Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) computer communication.
- The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the WiFi brand and are the world's most widely used wireless computer network standards.

- IEEE 802.11 is used in most home and office networks to allow laptops, printers, smartphones, and other devices to communicate with each other and access the internet **without connecting wires**.

- IEEE 802.11 is also a basis for **vehicle-based communication** networks with IEEE 802.11p.

- IEEE 802.11 uses various frequencies including, but not limited to 2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz, and 60 GHz frequency bands.

## General description

- The 802.11 Family consists of a series of half duplex over the air modulation techniques that use the same basic protocol.
- The 802.11 protocol family employs **Carrier-Sense Multiple Access** with **Collision Avoidance** (CMSMA/CA) whereby equipment listens to a channel for other users (including non 802.11 users) before transmitting each `frame` (some use the term `packet`).
